Q.3 Create your Django app in which after running the server, you should see on the 
browser, the text “Hello! I am learning Django”, which you defined in the index view.

Ans ->

"myapp/views.py" :

from django.http import HttpResponse

def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello! I am learning Django")


"myapp/urls.py":

from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('', views.index, name='index'),
]


"myproject/urls.py":

from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import include, path

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('myapp.urls')),
]


// Now, when you run the development server with python manage.py 
runserver and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser, 
you should see the text "Hello! I am learning Django".
